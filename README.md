# Opioid Environment Policy Scan (OEPS)

The Opioid Environment Policy Scan (OEPS) is an open source data ecosystem that helps characterize the multi-dimensional risk environment impacting opioid use and health outcomes across the United States.

This code base holds the all components of the OEPS project, including the CSV files that contain the raw data itself.

- OEPS Documentation:  [healthyregions.github.io/oeps](https://healthyregions.github.io/oeps)
    - The full, technical documentation deployed via Github pages.
    - **Start here** if you are looking to learn about how OEPS is put together, or are a developer that will be working on this code base.
- OEPS Explorer: [oeps.healthyregions.org](https://oeps.healthyregions.org)
    - The OEPS Explorer is a NextJS app built from [WebGeoda](https://docs.webgeoda.org/) (which uses [jsGeoDa](https://jsgeoda.libgeoda.org/)) for geospatial interactivity.
- OEPS Backend
    - The backend is a Flask app that manages the many variables and datasets that makeup the OEPS data warehouse.
    - The backend uses [Frictionless Standards](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io) internally and features multiple export pipelines to different systems.
    - The backend holds a registry as well as the raw CSV data itself.

## About OEPS

OEPS provides access to data at multiple spatial scales, from U.S. states down to Census tracts, as well different time periods, with data from 1980 to today. It is designed to support research seeking to study environments impacting and impacted by opioid use and opioid use disorder (OUD), inform public policy, and reduce harm in communities nationwide.

Variable constructs have been grouped thematically to highlight the multi-dimensional risk environment of opioid use in justice populations.  The variable themes are: **Geography, Social, Environment, Economic, Policy, Outcome,** and **Composite**.
