The federal share (FMAP) varies by state from a floor of 50% to a high of 74% with exceptions for certain services or populations. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility for adults under age 65 and provided the states that chose to expand with an Enhanced FMAP of 100% federal funding through 2016 for the newly eligible adults. The federal share for the expansion population phased down to 95% in 2017 and to 90% by 2020 and beyond.\n2. Spending is rounded to the nearest 100. States totals may not sum to national total due to rounding.\n3. Traditional medicaid spending refers to medicaid spending that does not include spending on adults enrolled in the ACA expansion group.\n4. Expansion group spending refers to spending for adults who have enrolled in Medicaid through the ACA's expansion of the program.\n5. N/A: Not applicable. State did not expand Medicaid as of September 2018.",
