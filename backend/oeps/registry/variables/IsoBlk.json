Basically, evenness involves the differential distribution of the subject population, exposure measures potential contact, concentration refers to the relative amount of physical space occupied, centralization indicates the degree to which a group is located near the center of an urban area, and clustering measures the degree to which minority group members live disproportionately in contiguous areas.\"\"\n\nNote: In all of the calculations, non-Hispanic whites are considered the \"majority\" (reference) population.",
