### Data Source(s) Description:  

Hepatitis C prevalence and mortality data was sourced from [HepVu](https://hepvu.org/), an online platform that collects, visualizes, and disseminates insights on data related to the viral hepatitis epidemic across the US. HepVu is a _Powered by AIDSVu_ project presented by the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in partnership with Gilead Sciences, Inc. 

#### Definitions:
**Hepatitis C Prevalence**: The data reflect persons with a positive or indeterminate anti-Hepatitis C virus (HCV) test and positive HCV RNA test.

**Hepatitis C Mortality**: The data reflect deaths among persons with acute viral hepatitis C or chronic viral hepatitis C as an underlying cause of death.

**Hepatitis C Prevalence Estimates**:

State-level Hepatitis C prevalence estimates (2013-2016 average) from HepVu were published by the Coalition for Applied Modeling for Prevention (CAMP) researchers. These estimates were calculated using four data sources – National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999-2016), National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (1999-2016), American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) (2012-2016), and U.S. Census intercensal data (1999-2016). The Hepatitis C prevalence analyses were restricted to people aged 18 years or older, living within the 50 states and D.C. For a complete description, see HepVu's [Data Methods](https://hepvu.org/data-methods/). 

**Hepatitis C Mortality Data**

The state-level Hepatitis C mortality data presented on HepVu (single-year data from 2005-2017) were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WONDER Online Database System and compiled by researchers at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. The CDC WONDER data are collected using information from death certificates of all U.S. residents within the 50 states and D.C. Deaths of residents of other U.S. territories and fetal deaths are not included. Demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information for each individual is recorded. Any records that included the ICD-10 code for acute viral hepatitis C (B17.1) or chronic viral hepatitis C (B18.2) as the underlying or multiple cause of death were used to identify deaths related to hepatitis C. For a complete description, see HepVu's [Data Methods](https://hepvu.org/data-methods/). 

### Description of Data Processing: 

Data was cleaned and prepared for analysis by aggregating multiple single year datasets for mortality data into single multi-year state-level datasets. Stability levels were removed for dataset preparation but are available for reference in the raw datasets. 

### Data Limitations: 

N/A

### Comments/Notes:

Data included for Hepatitis C State Mortality is for 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, while Hepatitis C State Prevalence data are available for 2013-2016- Only the mortality data have been updated as of 2025. Hepatitis C deaths for county level is available only for 2018-2020.
