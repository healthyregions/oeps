### Data Location: 
You can find the variables described in this document in the CSV files [here](https://oeps.healthyregions.org/download).  

CSV files are organized by **year** and **spatial scale**. For example, county-level variables from 2000 will be found in C_2000.csv.  

### Data Source(s) Description:  
Variables were obtained from the County Health rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R), a program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, draws attention to why there are differences in health within and across communities. The program highlights policies and practices that can help everyone be as healthy as possible. CHR&R aims to grow a shared understanding of health, equity and the power of communities to improve health for all. This work is rooted in a long-term vision where all people and places have what they need to thrive.a program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, draws attention to why there are differences in health within and across communities.

### Description of Data Processing: 
The following variable was included from the source data:  
- Percentage of smoking population
 
This measure was derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Adult smoking is the percentage of the adult population in a county who both report that they currently smoke every day or some days and have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. 

### Key Variable and Definitions:

- **Variable** -- title of variable
- **Variable ID** -- exact name of variable in datasets
- **Description** -- Short description of variable
- **Years Available** -- years for which data exists for this variable
- **Spatial Scale** -- the variable exists for these levels of spatial scale


#### County and State
| Variable | Variable ID in .csv | Description | Years Available | Spatial Scale |
|:---------|:--------------------|:------------|:----------------|:--------------|
| Percentage of smoking population | SmokeP | Percentage of Smoking Population | 2011-2025 | County, State |


### Data Limitations:
- The BRFSS only surveys adults (age 18 and older), lacking data on adolescent smoking. The Youth Behavioral Risk Factor Survey attempts to fill this gap, but it currently does not provide enough data to estimate county-level smoking prevalence among youth. BRFSS also currently only asks about the use of cigarettes and not e-cigarettes which have grown in prominence. Additionally, new methods using biomarkers have shown that not all smokers are exposed to the same level of contaminants.4 The simple “current smoker” status question does not capture the thousands of chemical compounds in cigarettes and cigarette smoke nor take into account the effects of secondhand smoke.
