# Metadata Writing Guidelines

## Overview 

- When any dataset is updated, edited, or added to OEPS, a corresponding metadata document must be generated or updated.
- When generating a new document from scratch, use the template document to start.
- In addition, you must update the registry file at: https://app.pagescms.org/healthyregions/oeps/main/collection/metadata
    - Learn more about this process here: https://healthyregions.github.io/oeps/guides/adding-data-to-oeps/#create-a-new-metadata-entry

### Tips

- The most recent author goes first in authorship. Please add yourself as an author even if you've only worked in updating the metadata file, not the data file. If there are questions about metadata, we'll need to know who to ask.
- Replace the last person who modified the file with your name. 'Last modified by' is only meant to have one name.
- Be sure to check URLs to ensure they are working. If not, update. 
- In addition to updating the table, also carefully read and update (if necessary) every other section. If the URL where you sourced the data changed this time, add that to the metadata source description. Indicated when you pulled data, when appropriate.
