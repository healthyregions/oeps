### Data Source(s) Description:  

Variables were obtained from the multiple periods of the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://data.census.gov) at State, County, Tract and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels.  

Prior to 2014, data was extracted from the Decennial Census.

### Description of Data Source Tables:

**Table B19301**: Per capita income in the past 12 months (in years' inflation-adjusted dollars) <br>

**Table S1701:** Poverty status in the past 12 months

### Description of Data Processing: 

The following variables were included from **B19301**.

  * **Estimate; Per capita income in the past 12 months (in years' inflation-adjusted dollars)**. Per capita income is the mean income computed for every man, woman, and child in a particular group including those living in group quarters. It is derived by dividing the aggregate income of a particular group by the total population in that group. This measure is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Note: Employment and unemployment estimates may vary from the official labor force data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics because of differences in survey design and data collection. 
 
The following variables were included from **S1701**:
  * **Percent Estimate; Percent below poverty level**. The total number of people below the poverty level is the sum of people in families and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes in the last 12 months below the poverty threshold. Note: Poverty status was determined for all people except institutionalized people, people in military group quarters, people in college dormitories, and unrelated individuals under 15 years old. These groups were excluded from the numerator and denominator when calculating poverty rates.

For more on variable definitions, see [ACS 2018 Subject Definitions](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2018_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf) as our intial reference that we replicated in subsequent time periods. 

### Data Limitations:

- The ACS does not gather information in the U.S. territories American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and U.S. Virgin Islands. It does include information for Puerto Rico & Washington, D.C.  
- Note that the Zip code scale data may only be available for more recent time periods due to changes in boundaries.
