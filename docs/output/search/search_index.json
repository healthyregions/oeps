The data itself is stored across many different CSV files, while a set of JSON files hold descriptive information about these CSV files and how they relate. Finally, a set of a \"geodata sources\" provide base geometries to which any of the data CSVs can be joined. With these pieces in mind, adding new data to OEPS has a few steps, and the first is preparation. Data preparation Incoming data must: Be stored CSV format Contain values for only one year and only one geography level For example, state-level population data for 1980, or tract-level housing data for 2018 Have proper column names (see below) Include an appropriate join column (see below) Naming columns If you are adding values for a variable that already exists in the registry, say, \"Total Population\", then your column must have the exact name that we already use for that variable, TotPop . If you are adding values for a new variable, then your columns must follow our existing naming conventions, and you'll need to supply extra information about that variable separately Configuring a join column A join column serves as the linkage between the non-spatial CSV data and geographic data like county boundaries. To facilitate this linkage, any incoming CSV must have one of these columns: GEOID For state, county, and tract data the GEOID is equivalent to the FIPS id. For ZCTA data, GEOID can match the zip code for each ZCTA. FIPS (for state, county, or tract data) FIPS ids are nested such that, for example, the 5-digit FIPS for a county includes the 2-digit FIPS for its state. ZCTA5 (for zip-code tabulation area (ZCTA) data) A ZCTA5 field is (essentially) the same as normal zip codes. HEROP_ID A HEROP_ID is our version of GEOID , which also includes a \"summary-level\" code on the front of it, indicating what geography level the id refers to. Registry preparation After the data has been prepared, the registry must also be prepared. The best way to do this is by asking these questions: 1. Is there a geodata target for this data already in the registry? If the new data must be joined to 2020 county boundaries, for example, is there already a geodata-source for that geography and vintage? If yes, great! Proceed to next step. If not, you need to create a new geodata source before continuing. 2. Is there an existing table source that matches the year and geography of the incoming data? If the new CSV contains county-level data for 2021, then is there already a county-2021 table source in the registry? If yes, great! Proceed to next step. If not, you need to create a new table-source before continuing. 3. Are all columns in the incoming data already defined in the OEPS registry? You can check this with the following command: flask inspect-csv -s path/to/MyNewCountyData2021.csv Note: You can run this command on a directory as well, and every CSV within it will be inspected. If yes, great! You are ready to merge data into OEPS . If no, you need to create a new variable entry for every new incoming variable. Registry operations Presented in logical order, though often only the later steps will be needed. Create a new geodata source Create a new table source Create a new variable entry Create a new construct Merge data into OEPS Create a new geodata source A geodata-source is a JSON file that points to one of the shapefiles we have in our geodata.healthyregions.org storage system. If you need a new geography level and/or vintage that is not already in the To create a new geodata-source, add a new JSON file named <summary level>-<year>.json . Using 2010 county boundaries as an example, name the file counties-2010.json and its content will look like this: { \"bq_dataset_name\": \"spatial\", \"bq_table_name\": \"counties2010\", \"name\": \"counties-2010\", \"title\": \"County Boundaries, 2010\", \"description\": \"Shapefile of county boundaries from the US Census Bureau, 2010.\", \"path\": \"https://herop-geodata.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/census/county-2010-500k-shp.zip\", \"format\": \"shp\", \"mediatype\": \"application/vnd.shp\", \"summary_level\": \"county\", \"schema\": { \"primaryKey\": \"HEROP_ID\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"HEROP_ID\", \"title\": \"HEROP_ID\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } } Note: Currently, we use plurals in geodata-source names, \"counties\", instead of \"county\" which we use elsewhere. In the future, geodata source definitions will not use plural. Note: The bq* attributes are used for Google BigQuery, and are likely to be removed in the future. Create a new table source The following command can be used to create a new table source: flask create-table-source -n <name> -g <geodata-source> For example, to add a new table source to hold county-level data for the year 2021 (which will join to 2020 geometries) use this command: flask create-table-source -n county-2021 -g counties-2020 This command will do two things: Using the specified geodata-source, create a \"dummy\" CSV in data/tables named county-2021.csv that only contains join columns--essentially a placeholder file into which new data can be merged Create a new JSON file for this table-source, registry/table-sources/county-2021.json that adds the new CSV to the registry. Note: Currently, we use plurals in geodata-source names, \"counties\", instead of \"county\" which we use elsewhere. In the future, geodata source definitions will not use plural. Create a new variable entry In registry/variables.json there is a single entry for each variable that has values for any geography level or any year within OEPS. Currently, adding new variables is a manual process, just directly edit the content of that file. A full variable definition looks like this: \"TotPop\": { \"title\": \"Total Population\", \"name\": \"TotPop\", \"type\": \"integer\", \"example\": \"1632480\", \"description\": \"Total population\", \"constraints\": \"1980-2000 historic data was acquired from NHGIS and then interpolated to modern county boundaries through a population weighted interpolation using the tidycensus `interpolate_pw` function.

If you are adding a variable that part of a new construct, then you must also create a new construct . table_sources must start as an empty list, and will fill up with the names of table sources that hold values for this variable, as more and more data is merged into the system. Create a new theme or construct OEPS is built on a conceptual framework that places different measures (or, \"variables\") into different themes and constructs. This grouping is defined in the registry/themes.json file, which lists \"themes\" at the top-level and then nests one or more constructs within each theme. To add a new construct or theme, just edit that file directly. Once you are finished, you'll need to regenerate the docs content for the OEPS explorer. flask build-explorer-docs Merge data into OEPS Once both the incoming data and the registry have been prepared, you can merge in an external CSV with this command, using a new set of county-level 2021 data as an example. flask merge-data-table -s path/to/MyNewCountyData2021.csv -t county-2021 --dry-run It is wise to use the --dry-run flag to test the merge before actually altering any data. What this command will do: Load the incoming CSV data, and check for a join field ( GEOID , FIPS , ZCTA5 , or HEROP_ID ) If one of these is present, it will be used to generate a HEROP_ID which is the actual join field that will be used during the process Load the specified table source CSV in the registry and merge these two data frames Write out the merged data frame into the existing table source Update the table_sources attribute in varibles.json for variable in the incoming CSV Once you have completed this operation for one or more CSVs, you will (eventually) need to regenerate the many various data outputs needed to push these updates to all OEPS venues.

The backend includes commands for managing data transformation to and from to different destinations, as well as a registry to define all aspects of the data within OEPS. Getting Started Install the backend Python Package Clone this repo git clone https://github.com/healthyregions/oeps cd oeps/backend Create and activate a Python virtual environment with venv , Conda , or your other tool of choice. For example, using the venv module that is included in Python 3, the commands will be: python3 -m venv env source ./env/bin/activate This will create a new directory env/ , and when properly activated your command prompt will have a (env) prefix. Install this package and its dependencies pip install -e . Create a .env file from the provided template (no need to update any values right now) cp .env.example .env You can now run any commands with flask [command] To see what commands are available, run flask --help You should see a printout that lists about 10 commands. If you only see three commands ( routes , run , and shell ): These are default flask commands and you either need to activate your virtual environment or make sure you have a .env file with FLASK_APP=oeps in it. (for development only) pip install -e .[dev] pip install md-click@git+https://github.com/kid-116/md-click@support-arguments The md-click library is used to generate documentation of the CLI commands, and the particular branch is needed to handle Arguments on the commands that are being documented. Hopefull, this PR will be merged at some point and this install process could be updated: https://github.com/RiveryIO/md-click/pull/12. There is a dependency resolution bug (or something) when putting that github reference directly in the pyproject.toml file, so it needs to be run separately after everything else is installed. JCOIN section in progress Google BigQuery Setup BigQuery Credentials To use the BigQuery script ( scripts/bq.py ) you will need to add access credentials as environment variables using the .env file. This file must always stay out of version control. Make a copy of .env.example and name it .env . Any variables defined in this file will now be available via os.getenv('VARIABLE_NAME') Obtain a set of JSON credentials for the project, and store the file anywhere on your computer (but outside of this repository). In your .env file, update the BQ_CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH variable with the full path to this file. For example: BQ_CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH=\"/home/my_username/bq_credentials/oeps-391119-5783b2b59b83.json\" It is also possible to set BigQuery credentials without storing a local JSON file. More info on this is in the .env.example file. Once you have setup these credentials, you can test them with python ./scripts/bq.py check-credentials If all is well, the command will print ok . BigQuery Import/Export The bq.py script can perform import and export operations on our BigQuery database. Importing Data Use the following command to load a new table into BigQuery: python ./scripts/bq.py load --source ./resources Where --source is the path to a Data Resource schema (stored as JSON file), or a directory containing multiple Data Resource schemas. Optional flags on this command are: --table-only will create the BigQuery dataset and table based on the schema, but will not attempt to load data into it. --dry-run will validate the input dataset against the schema, but not attempt to load it. --overwrite will drop and recreate the BigQuery table if it already exists in the dataset. Exporting Data Use the following command to query the OEPS BigQuery tables: python scripts/bq.py export --sql sql/states.sql --output states.shp Where states.sql is an example of a file that holds the SQL query to perform against one or more tables. In the SQL, PROJECT_ID is a placeholder (it will be replaced with the actual project identifier before the query is performed), such that table references look like PROJECT_ID.dataset_name.table_name , or PROJECT_ID.spatial.states2018 for the table that holds state boundaries. --sql-file path to a file whose contents is a complete SQL query. --output is the name of a file to which the query results will be written. Either .csv or .shp files can be specified, and if a spatial result is written to CSV the geometries will be in WKT format. If this argument is omitted, the query results will be printed to the console (helpful for testing queries). You can write your own SQL into a file and use the same command to perform your query and export the results. Use the big-query-tables page for quick access to all table and column names. Table Definitions A table definition is a JSON file that specifies The location of a source dataset to load The Google BigQuery project and table name to load into A thorough schema defining all fields from the source dataset and how they will be stored in BigQuery This information is used in various contexts to Create (or re-create) table schemas in BigQuery Load data into these tables Export data from BigQuery into various formats and file types The structure of a table definition is inspired by the Table Schema specification published by Frictionless Standards , with a few additions for our own use case. Structure The top-level properties of a table definition are: Property Format Description path String Path or URL for CSV or SHP dataset to load bq_table_name String Target table in BigQuery bq_dataset_name String Target dataset in BigQuery fields List List of definitions for all table fields Note that in BigQuery, a dataset is akin to a database in other RDBS implementations, such that a dataset holds one or more tables. Often, tables are identified by their fully-qualified identifier: project_id.dataset_name.table_name . The fields property is a list of one or more field objects, as described below. The only requirement of the fields list is that must contain an entry for a HEROP_ID field. This is our unique GIS join field. Field Descriptors Fields are defined by a JSON object that adheres to the field descriptors portion of the table schema standard, though not all possible attributes are required or implemented. Property Format Description OEPS Use name String Canonical name for this column (used in BigQuery) Required title String A nicer human readable label or title for the field Required type String A string specifying the type. See types . Required format String A string specifying a format Not Implemented example String An example value for the field Optional description String A description for the field Optional constraints JSON A constraints descriptor Not Implemented The following additional attributes are also supported and in some cases required: Property Format Description OEPS Use theme String One of Social , Environment , Economic , Policy , Outcome , or Geography . See OEPS docs . Optional comment String Additional information about the data in this field Optional source String Source of the data in this field Optional max_length Integer Max length of field (used in BigQuery schema) Optional HEROP_ID Field For now, please see this comment for a detailed description of how HEROP_ID values are constructed. A field descriptor for this field will look something like this: { \"name\": \"HEROP_ID\", \"type\": \"string\", \"example\": \"040US01-2018\", \"description\": \"A derived unique id corresponding to the relevant geographic unit.\", \"theme\": \"Geography\", } Geometry Fields To load a shapefile you must include the following field descriptor in your fields list: { \"name\": \"geom\", \"title\": \"Geom\", \"type\": \"string\" } Note that for spatial data Table Schema only allows geojson or geopoint as valid geographic types, while Google BigQuery uses GEOGRAPHY . For now, we'll just use the above configuration, and more nuances can be pursued down the road. Example The following is a truncated version of a table definition for the 2010 State-level data published in OEPS v2.0. This defines a table project_id.tabular.S_2010 with two fields, HEROP_ID and TotPop .

The registry serves as a central content hub from which all data export and transformation operations can be carried out, via CLI commands. The registry seeks to achieve the following: Reduce duplicative variable and source metadata representations Facilitate export to multiple configurations and formats, specifically MS Excel Data Dictionaries (for general reference) OEPS Explorer JCOIN data commons Google BigQuery Provide a framework for future addition of variables The composition of the registry is largely inspired by Frictionless data specs, which are used to generate Data Packages , Data Resources , and other forms of data dictionaries and downloadable content. The registry is broken into four parts: themes & constructs variables table sources geodata sources Rationale The core rationale for this setup is to treat individual variables as the lowest common denominator within the system, allowing the concept of a variable to be shared across as many tables and data sources as needed. For example, \"Total Population\" is a variable that has a value in 16 different tables--by state in 2010, by county in 2010, by state in 2000, etc. The registry allows us to define this variable one time, and then link it with multiple data sources, each of which in turn links to the proper geospatial dataset. Themes and constructs provide a mechanism through which variables can be organized within the risk environment framework, creating a thematic hierarchy without directly affecting the structure of the data or datasets themselves. Structure The variables.json file holds a comprehensive lookup of all individual variables that are present in any source file, each defined by a suite of metadata properties that describe. One of these properties, table_sources is a list of ids for all table sources in which a value for this variable can be found. Each table source (CSV) is in turn described by a JSON file in the table_sources directory, and linked via a geodata_source property to a similar entry in the geodata_sources directory. All joins must be performed on the HEROP_ID field. The diagram above illustrates how three different example variables would be defined and connected to data sources. Only the necessary properties are shown for each item, but a detailed explanation of all properties can be found in the following sections. To explain the example: ParkArea is a state level calculation (area of parks within a state) and it has only been calculated for 2010, so it is only stored in one table, called s-2010 here. TotPop (total population) has a value in many different tables: at the state, county, and tract level in 2010 ( s-2010 , c-2010 , and t-2010 , respectively), as well as at the state level in 2000 ( s-2000 ). As you can see, the table_sources field in TotPop lists all of these table ids. MetTmDr is the average drive time (in minutes) for how long it takes to access a methadone provider. This variable has only been calculated at the tract level, using 2010 data. Though these three variables are present in four different data source tables, you will notice that these tables only link to three different geodata sources. This is because both of the state-level data sources, 2010 and 2000, can be joined to the same single states geodata source. While this is a very small example (currently we have over 300 variables), it should be enough to illustrate the theoretical flexibility of the setup. themes Themes are a very lightweight grouping of \"constructs\" that represent a variable (or a group of variables) at a conceptual level. Alongside each construct is a \"proxy\"; this is just a short description of all variables that fit within this construct. The structure of the themes.json file is very simple: { \"<theme name>\": { \"<construct 1>\": \"<proxy for concept 1>\", \"<construct 2>\": \"<proxy for concept 2>\", } } and with some real example values: { \"Social\": { \"Age\": \"Age group estimates and percentages of population\", \"Race & Ethnicity\": \"Percentages of population defined by categories of race and ethnicity\", } } Each variable is matched to one construct via its construct propert (see below). Themes, construct, and proxies are only used in certain export formats, and are not a structurally central aspect of the registry. variables A single file, variable.json , serves as a central lookup for all variables, each one being defined as a Frictionless Field Descriptor , with some extra properties that we have added for our own needs. The key for each item in the lookup must be the same as its name property. name - Canonical name of the variable, same as key for this item, must be CamelCase and <= 10 characters long. title - Human-readable title. type - The type of data in this column, must be one of Frictionless field types . example - An example value in this field. description - A one or two sentence description. constraints - Any data usage constraints that are relevant for this variable. comments - Any extra comments about this variable's creation that don't fit into other properties. construct - A \"construct\" string that is present within the themes.json file (see above) source - Creator of this variable, abbreviations ok. source_long - Long-form version of source oeps_v1_table - If applicable, the name of the data table that this variable was stored in in OEPS v1. metadata_doc_url - URL to raw content for a Markdown-formatted metadata document (this content is read and loaded directly into the explorer webpages). longitudinal - true / false , appropriate for longitudinal comparison. analysis - true / false table_sources - A list of data_source identifiers, must match identiers in the sources.json file.

Where the schema typically defines a primary key, foreign key (for joins), and a list of all fields, all of this information is inferred or standardized elsewhere and need not be stored in these files. There are a few rules for how a CSV can be constructed: It must have a HEROP_ID column that joins each row to a geography unit. It must only have data for a single geography category within it. Ideally it will only have values for a single publication year (though we don't yet have this enforced).
