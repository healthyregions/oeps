The data itself is stored across many different CSV files, while a set of JSON files hold descriptive information about these CSV files and how they relate. Finally, a set of a \"geodata sources\" provide base geometries to which any of the data CSVs can be joined. With these pieces in mind, adding new data to OEPS is a multi-step process. Adding Data to OEPS Data preparation Naming columns Configuring a join column Registry preparation Is there a geodata target for this data already in the registry? Is there an existing table source that matches the year and geography of the incoming data? Are all columns in the incoming data already defined in the OEPS registry? Workflow Create a new geodata source Create a new table source Getting started with PagesCMS Create a new variable entry Create a new metadata entry Merge data into OEPS Data preparation Incoming data: MUST be stored CSV format MUST contain values for only one year and only one geography level MUST have proper column names (see below) MUST include an appropriate join column (see below) MAY have data for as many different variables as needed Naming columns If you are adding values for a variable that already exists in the registry, say, \"Total Population\", then your column must have the exact name that we already use for that variable, TotPop . If you are adding values for a new variable, then your columns must follow our existing naming conventions, and you'll need to create a new entry for that variable as described below. Configuring a join column A join column serves as the linkage between the non-spatial CSV data and geographic data like county boundaries. To facilitate this linkage, any incoming CSV must have one of these columns: Name Geography Description GEOID all For state, county, and tract data the GEOID is equivalent to the FIPS id. For ZCTA data, GEOID can match the zip code or ZCTA5 for each ZCTA. FIPS state, county, tract FIPS ids are nested such that, for example, the 5-digit FIPS for a county includes the 2-digit FIPS for its state. ZCTA5 zcta 5-digit zip code that corresponds with the zip code tabulation area. HEROP_ID all A HEROP_ID is our version of GEOID , which also includes a \"summary-level\" code on the front of it, indicating what geography level the id refers to. Registry preparation After the data has been prepared, the registry must also be prepared. The best way to do this is by asking these questions: Is there a geodata target for this data already in the registry? If the new data must be joined to 2020 county boundaries, for example, is there already a geodata-source for that geography and vintage? If yes, great! Proceed to next question. If not, you need to create a new geodata source before continuing. Is there an existing table source that matches the year and geography of the incoming data? If the new CSV contains county-level data for 2021, then is there already a county-2021 table source in the registry? If yes, great! Proceed to next question. If not, you need to create a new table-source before continuing. Are all columns in the incoming data already defined in the OEPS registry? You can check this with the following command: flask inspect-csv -s path/to/MyNewCountyData2021.csv Note You can run this command on a directory as well, and every CSV within it will be inspected. If yes, great! You are ready to merge data into OEPS . If no, you need to create a new variable entry for every new incoming variable. Workflow Listed here in logical order, though often only the later steps will be needed. Create a new geodata source Create a new table source Create a new variable entry Create a new theme or construct Merge data into OEPS Create a new geodata source A geodata source is a JSON file that points to one of the zipped shapefiles we have in our geodata.healthyregions.org S3 storage system. If you need a new geography level and/or vintage that is not already in S3, see github.com/healthyregions/geodata to learn how to add it. To create a new geodata source, add a new JSON file named <summary level>-<year>.json . Using 2010 county boundaries as an example, name the file counties-2010.json and its content will look like this: { \"bq_dataset_name\": \"spatial\", \"bq_table_name\": \"counties2010\", \"name\": \"counties-2010\", \"title\": \"County Boundaries, 2010\", \"description\": \"Shapefile of county boundaries from the US Census Bureau, 2010.\", \"path\": \"https://herop-geodata.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/census/county-2010-500k-shp.zip\", \"format\": \"shp\", \"mediatype\": \"application/vnd.shp\", \"summary_level\": \"county\", \"schema\": { \"primaryKey\": \"HEROP_ID\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"HEROP_ID\", \"title\": \"HEROP_ID\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } } Note Currently, we use plurals in geodata-source names, \"counties\", instead of \"county\" which we use elsewhere. In the future, geodata source definitions will not use plural. Note The bq* attributes are used for Google BigQuery, and are likely to be removed in the future. Tip See geodata sources for a full explanation of geodata sources. Create a new table source The following command can be used to create a new table source: flask create-table-source -n <name> -g <geodata-source> For example, to add a new table source to hold county-level data for the year 2021 (which will join to 2020 geometries) use this command: flask create-table-source -n county-2021 -g counties-2020 This command will do two things: Using the specified geodata-source, create a \"dummy\" CSV in data/tables named county-2021.csv that only contains join columns--essentially a placeholder file into which new data can be merged Create a new JSON file for this table-source, registry/table-sources/county-2021.json that adds the new CSV to the registry. Tip See table sources for a full explanation of table sources. Getting started with PagesCMS Some elements of the registry can be directly edited through an online interface called PagesCMS. Here's how you can get started with this. Go to app.pagescms.org/healthyregions/oeps/main Sign in with GitHub if needed Once logged in, you'll see oeps and main in the left-hand menu Click this button and go to > \"Manage branches\" Create a new branch with a descriptive name, add_my_new_variable You'll now see oeps and add_my_new_variable in the left-hand menu Perform the edits you need to do All work will be committed directly to your new branch. When you are ready, go to the actual GitHub repo, https://github.com/healthyregions/oeps/pulls, and create a new pull request into main from your branch. Create a new variable entry In registry/variables there are individual files for each variable with data in OEPS. Instead of editing these files directly, we can edit them through PagesCMS. See getting started with PagesCMS to continue. Some data entry notes: name must follow these rules: Follow abbreviation patterns we already use Follow PascalCase For example, use TotPop , not tot_pop or totPop or tot-pop type must be one of: number for any decimal number values integer for any integer values string for text values, for example a coded entry boolean for true/false or yes/no values date for date values see Frictionless field data types for more info table_sources leave this blank, it should not be edited in PagesCMS. Tip See variables for a full explanation of variables. Create a new metadata entry In registry/metadata there are individual files for each metadata entry. Instead of editing these files directly, we can edit them through PagesCMS. Note The actual metadata markdown files themselves are stored at the top of the main repo, in /metadata . In the future, we could further integrate them with the registry so that these files are also edited directly in PagesCMS. To add a new metadata entry, you should begin the process in GitHub by creating a new branch and added a new markdown file to in this directory: https://github.com/healthyregions/oeps/tree/main/metadata. Create your file based on https://github.com/healthyregions/oeps/tree/main/metadata/metadata-template.md. With your markdown file complete, you need to create an entry for it in PagesCMS. See getting started with PagesCMS , and be sure to use the branch you have already created (no need to make a new one). Once the new metadata entry has been created, you can also attach new variables to it if needed. After a pull request has been merged into the main branch, this command will need to be run to update the docs page in the OEPS Explorer: flask build-explorer-docs Tip See metadata for a full explanation of metadata entries. Merge data into OEPS Once both the incoming data and the registry have been prepared, you can merge in an external CSV with this command, using a new set of county-level 2021 data as an example. flask merge-data-table -s path/to/MyNewCountyData2021.csv -t county-2021 --dry-run It is wise to use the --dry-run flag to test the merge before actually altering any data. What this command will do: Load the incoming CSV data, and check for a join field ( GEOID , FIPS , ZCTA5 , or HEROP_ID ) If one of these is present, it will be used to generate a HEROP_ID which is the actual join field that will be used during the process Load the specified table source CSV in the registry and merge these two data frames Write out the merged data frame into the existing table source Update the table_sources attribute in varibles.json for variable in the incoming CSV Once you have completed this operation for one or more CSVs, you will need to perform some or all of these actions to make sure the derived output from OEPS is up-to-date: Re-provision the OEPS Explorer Re-create any output data packages Regenerate data dictionaries Regenerate the registry summary Sync data to BigQuery Regenerate the BigQuery reference table","title":"Adding Data to OEPS"},{"location":"guides/adding-data-to-oeps/#adding-data-to-oeps","text":"Because the OEPS backend must export the same data to many different formats, we have a registry that configures and manages all of the data within the system.

Each component operates independently, so there is no need to install them all at once. To begin, clone the repo locally, git clone https://github.com/healthyregions/oeps then you can install any of the following components: OEPS Explorer OEPS Backend OEPS Documentation OEPS Explorer To get started locally with the explorer: cd oeps/explorer yarn install cp .env.example .env Some environment variable values will already be set in .env , but you'll need to add a Mapbox token. Then run yarn dev and open http://localhost:3000 More about Mapbox dependencies Two Mapbox Tilesets must be configured externally and linked within this app, one for Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and one for Census Tracts. These geometries are joined with CSV tables to drive map visualizations. Additionally, a basemap style must be provided, as well as a Mapbox access token. All of these elements are (currently) provided through environment variables, so make sure your .env file has the following: NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=<your token> NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_STYLE=\"mapbox://styles/<account id>/<style id>\" OEPS Backend The OEPS Backend is a suite of command line tools, built within the Flask framework. Using the backend does not require a long running process or external database. It simply automates certain operations that are performed on files within the repository. After an operation has been performed, it is typically necessary to commit the changes and then create a pull request. In the future, perhaps it will make sense to convert some of the operations to API routes, but for now Flask is merely a wrapper. Install Python dependencies Using Docker The easiest way to run backend commands is to use Docker--no need to create a Python virtual environment. Simply enter the backend directory and run: docker compose run -it oeps [CLI COMMAND] For example, to print help for all of the commands, run docker compose run -it oeps flask --help and you should get a printout of about 10 commands. If you are making changes to the backend code, then include the --build flag to rebuild the container during the command: docker compose run -it oeps [CLI COMMAND] Because the build process takes a little while, you may want to create a local install for more rapid development. Local install Enter the backend directory cd oeps/backend Create and activate a Python virtual environment with venv , Conda , or your other tool of choice. For example, using the venv module that is included in Python 3, the commands will be: python3 -m venv env source ./env/bin/activate This will create a new directory env/ , and when properly activated your command prompt will have a (env) prefix. Install this package and its dependencies pip install -e . Create a .env file from the provided template (no need to update any values right now) cp .env.example .env Success!

The registry serves as a central content hub from which all data export and transformation operations can be carried out, via CLI commands. The registry is made up of these four components: metadata variables table sources geodata sources Rationale The core rationale for this setup is to treat individual variables as the lowest common denominator within the system, allowing the concept of a variable to be shared across as many tables and data sources as needed. For example, \"Total Population\" is a variable that has a value in 16 different tables--by state in 2010, by county in 2010, by state in 2000, etc. The registry allows us to define this variable one time, and then link it with multiple data sources, each of which in turn links to the proper geospatial dataset. Thus, the registry seeks to achieve the following: Reduce duplicative variable and source metadata representations Facilitate export to multiple configurations and formats, specifically Provide a framework for future addition of variables The composition of the registry is largely inspired by Frictionless data specs, which are used to generate Data Packages , Data Resources , and other forms of data dictionaries and downloadable content. Themes and constructs provide a mechanism through which variables can be organized within the risk environment framework, creating a thematic hierarchy without directly affecting the structure of the data or datasets themselves. Structure The variables.json file holds a comprehensive lookup of all individual variables that are present in any source file, each defined by a suite of metadata properties that describe. One of these properties, table_sources is a list of ids for all table sources in which a value for this variable can be found. Each table source (CSV) is in turn described by a JSON file in the table_sources directory, and linked via a geodata_source property to a similar entry in the geodata_sources directory. All joins must be performed on the HEROP_ID field. The diagram above illustrates how three different example variables would be defined and connected to data sources. Only the necessary properties are shown for each item, but a detailed explanation of all properties can be found in the following sections. To explain the example: ParkArea is a state level calculation (area of parks within a state) and it has only been calculated for 2010, so it is only stored in one table, called s-2010 here. TotPop (total population) has a value in many different tables: at the state, county, and tract level in 2010 ( s-2010 , c-2010 , and t-2010 , respectively), as well as at the state level in 2000 ( s-2000 ). As you can see, the table_sources field in TotPop lists all of these table ids. MetTmDr is the average drive time (in minutes) for how long it takes to access a methadone provider. This variable has only been calculated at the tract level, using 2010 data. Though these three variables are present in four different data source tables, you will notice that these tables only link to three different geodata sources. This is because both of the state-level data sources, 2010 and 2000, can be joined to the same single states geodata source. While this is a very small example (currently we have over 300 variables), it should be enough to illustrate the theoretical flexibility of the setup. What's in the Registry? The easiest way to browse all entries in the registry is to filter through the following CSV files that are stored in Github. metadata.csv \u2197 variables.csv \u2197 table_sources.csv \u2197 geodata_sources.csv \u2197 These files are derived from the JSON files that make up the registry, and should generatelly be up-to-date.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"registry/#overview","text":"The backend app includes a registry directory that holds a structured representation of all data within the OEPS warehouse.
