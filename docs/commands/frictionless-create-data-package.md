# frictionless create-data-package

Generates a Frictionless data package from the Data Resource definitions in this backend. This export
process was developed specifically to support integration of the OEPS data warehouse into the JCOIN commons.

The resulting package will be validated against the `frictionless` standard using that Python library. Use
`--no-foreign-keys` to allow validation to pass when shapefiles are involved in join fields.


## Usage

```
Usage: frictionless create-data-package [OPTIONS]
```

## Arguments


## Options

* `destination`:
    * Type: STRING
    * Default: `../.cache`
    * Usage: `--destination
-d`

    Output location for export directory. The package will be placed within this directory and given a name generated from the current date and time.



* `source`:
    * Type: STRING
    * Default: `data/resources`
    * Usage: `--source
-s`

    Path to a data resource JSON file to export, or a directory containing multiple data resources.



* `zip_`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--zip`

    Zip the output data package.



* `upload`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--upload`

    Upload the zipped data package to S3. Bucket is determined by `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable.



* `no_cache`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--no-cache`

    Force re-download of any remote files.



* `skip_foreign_keys`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--skip-foreign-keys`

    Don't define foreign keys in the output data package. This is needed to avoid validation errors that occur when Shapefiles are used in foreign keys.



* `overwrite`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--overwrite`

    Overwrite existing data package with the same name.



* `help`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--help`

    Show this message and exit.
