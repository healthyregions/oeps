# OEPS Documentation

This documentation aims to be a comprehensive explantation of how the Opioid Policy Environment Scan (OEPS, or "oh-eeps") data ecosystem is put together, and a technical resource for developers working on the code base. It also contains information for analysts preparing and adding new data, and guides for researchers looking to download or otherwise access OEPS data.

This project builds from the original data warehouse stored in [github.com/GeoDaCenter/opioid-policy-scan](https://github.com/GeoDaCenter/opioid-policy-scan), and published on Zenodo at [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5842465](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5842465).
