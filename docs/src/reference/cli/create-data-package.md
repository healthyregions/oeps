# create-data-package

Generates a Frictionless data package from the Data Resource definitions in this backend. This export
    process was developed specifically to support integration of the OEPS data warehouse into the JCOIN commons.

    The resulting package will be validated against the `frictionless` standard using that Python library.

    `--skip-foreign-keys` to skip the creation of foreign keys--useful because foreign keys to shapefiles break
    validation.

    `--skip-validation` to skip the final step of running validation on the output package.
    

## Usage

```
Usage: create-data-package [OPTIONS]
```

## Arguments


## Options

* `destination`:
    * Type: <click.types.Path object at 0x714f4c1e6e30>
    * Default: `.temp/data-packages`
    * Usage: `--destination
-d`

    Output location for export directory. The package will be placed within this directory and given a name generated from the current date and time.



* `zip_`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--zip`

    Zip the output data package.



* `upload`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--upload`

    Upload the zipped data package to S3. Bucket is determined by `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable.



* `no_cache`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--no-cache`

    Force re-download of any remote files.



* `skip_foreign_keys`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--skip-foreign-keys`

    Don't define foreign keys in the output data package. This is needed to avoid validation errors that occur when Shapefiles are used in foreign keys.



* `skip_validation`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--skip-validation`

    Don't run data package validation on the final output.



* `overwrite`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--overwrite`

    Overwrite output content if it already exists.



* `registry_path`:
    * Type: <click.types.Path object at 0x714f4c5ee650>
    * Default: `oeps/registry`
    * Usage: `--registry-path`

    Optional override for the registry directory.



* `verbose`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--verbose`

    Enable verbose logging.



* `help`:
    * Type: BOOL
    * Default: `False`
    * Usage: `--help`

    Show this message and exit.
