## Scripts

This directory will serve as a holding place for scripts that we use for fetching, cleaning, and saving data from external API. Scripts in here should be created as "standalone" operations, in that each one can be run independently.

In the future, the output from these scripts can go straight into the data backend, but this integration isn't quite configured yet.
